  Dataset: This notebook uses the IRIS dataset, which includes 150 rows and 5 columns: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and   
  class.
  Visualization: The data is visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.
  Data Splitting: The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.
  Modeling: Various machine learning models from sklearn are used, including:
  - LogisticRegression
  - LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
  - KNeighborsClassifier
  - DecisionTreeClassifier
  - GaussianNB
  - SVC
  Evaluation: The best-fit model for the IRIS dataset is identified based on the evaluation.
